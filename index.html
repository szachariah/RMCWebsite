    NASA RMC is an annually held competition held at the NASA Kennedy Space
    Center, Florida where teams from different communities and universities
    build robots that traverse and mine Martian soil (regolith). NASA’s ultimate
    objective for this competition is for the further advancement of Space
    Exploration. This in turn, NASA has given college students the task to find
    innovative mining techniques to be used for obtaining the water-ice found
    under the surface of the Martian soil. As a result, this will allow humans
    to “live off the land” or in scientific terms “In-Situ Resource Utilization
    (ISRU)”. In the competition, points are awarded based on creative design,
    amount of regolith mined, autonomous operation of the robot, and innovative
    ideas.

    This year, the students will be attempting a new design to increase mining
    performance and further implementation of autonomous operation. The current
    design our team is pursuing is a “bucket ladder mixed with the auger design”
    (Figure 2, Figure 3). They are both known for aggressive mining, especially
    when working with gravel like substance (icy regolith). The drive system of
    the robot is called, “Rocker Bogie” (Figure 4) which is a specific type of
    drivetrain famously used by the Mars rover, Curiosity. This drivetrain works
    best especially when driving on uneven terrain like Martian soil. We also
    plan to use small brushless motors to maintain a lightweight design and give
    us the extra power to traverse the Martian terrain. In order to power the
    robot, we plan to use Lithium-Polymer battery packs which allow high current
    draw rate, which would be ideal for our drive system.
